Demo tutorial written in Markdown syntax
========================================

This is a first step
--------------------

In this *first* step, we have this first paragraph of text that
contains an emphasized part.

Then this second paragraph is just plain text.

    (* then we have a
       block of OCaml code *)
    2 + 2 ;;

Finally, this paragraph contains some `code`.

## This is step number `0x02`

Now we show how to make some code `| clickable () |`.

    | (* then we have a clickable
    |    block of OCaml code *)
    | 2 + 2 ;;

## This is a `$3^rd$` step

Here we have an enumeration:

  * This is point number `| let one = 1 |`.

  * This is point number `| let second = succ one |`.

  * This is point number `| succ second |`.
