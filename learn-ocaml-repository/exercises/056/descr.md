# Statement

Let us call a binary tree symmetric if you can draw a vertical line
through the root node and then the right subtree is the mirror image of
the left subtree. Write a function `is_symmetric` to check whether a
given binary tree is symmetric.

**Hint:** Write a function `is_mirror` first to check whether one tree
 is the mirror image of another. We are only interested in the
 structure, not in the contents of the nodes.
