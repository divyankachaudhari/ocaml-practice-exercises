# Statement

Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists.

1. We suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves.
The objective is to sort the elements of this list according to their
length. E.g. short lists first, longer lists later, or vice versa.

2. Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are lists
themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements of this
list according to their **length frequency**; i.e., in the default,
where sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed
first, others with a more frequent length come later.

```ocaml
# length_sort [["a"; "b"; "c"]; ["d"; "e"]; ["f"; "g"; "h"]; ["d"; "e"];
             ["i"; "j"; "k"; "l"]; ["m"; "n"]; ["o"]];;
- : string list list =
[["o"]; ["d"; "e"]; ["d"; "e"]; ["m"; "n"]; ["a"; "b"; "c"]; ["f"; "g"; "h"];
 ["i"; "j"; "k"; "l"]]
# frequency_sort [["a"; "b"; "c"]; ["d"; "e"]; ["f"; "g"; "h"]; ["d"; "e"];
                ["i"; "j"; "k"; "l"]; ["m"; "n"]; ["o"]];;
- : string list list =
[["i"; "j"; "k"; "l"]; ["o"]; ["a"; "b"; "c"]; ["f"; "g"; "h"]; ["d"; "e"];
 ["d"; "e"]; ["m"; "n"]]
