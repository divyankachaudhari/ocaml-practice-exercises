# Statement

Given two indices, `i` and `k`, the slice is the list containing the
elements between the `i`'th and `k`'th element of the original list
(both limits included). Start counting the elements with 0 (this is the
way the `List` module numbers elements).

```ocaml
# slice ["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"; "h"; "i"; "j"] 2 6;;
- : string list = ["c"; "d"; "e"; "f"; "g"]
```
