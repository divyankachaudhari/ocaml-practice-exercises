A node of a binary tree is at level N if the path from the root to the
node has length N-1. The root node is at level 1. Write a function
`at_level t l` to collect all nodes of the tree `t` at level `l` in a
list.

```ocaml
# let example_tree =
  Node ('a', Node ('b', Node ('d', Empty, Empty), Node ('e', Empty, Empty)),
       Node ('c', Empty, Node ('f', Node ('g', Empty, Empty), Empty)));;
val example_tree : char binary_tree =
  Node ('a', Node ('b', Node ('d', Empty, Empty), Node ('e', Empty, Empty)),
   Node ('c', Empty, Node ('f', Node ('g', Empty, Empty), Empty)))
# at_level example_tree 2;;
- : char list = ['b'; 'c']
```

Using `at_level` it is easy to construct a function `levelorder` which
creates the level-order sequence of the nodes. However, there are more
efficient ways to do that.
