Modify the result of the previous problem in such a way that if an
element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only
elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.

Since OCaml lists are homogeneous, one needs to define a type to hold
both single elements and sub-lists.

<!-- $MDX skip -->
```ocaml
type 'a rle =
  | One of 'a
  | Many of int * 'a
```

```ocaml
# encode ["a"; "a"; "a"; "a"; "b"; "c"; "c"; "a"; "a"; "d"; "e"; "e"; "e"; "e"];;
- : string rle list =
[Many (4, "a"); One "b"; Many (2, "c"); Many (2, "a"); One "d";
 Many (4, "e")]
```
