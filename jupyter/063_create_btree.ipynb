    "# Question 063: Construct a Complete Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a complete binary tree from a list of elements, and make sure it satisfies the property of being 'left-adjusted'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implement the function definition below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A *complete* binary tree with height H is defined as follows: The levels\n",
    "1,2,3,...,H-1 contain the maximum number of nodes (i.e 2<sup>i-1</sup>\n",
    "at the level i, note that we start counting the levels from 1 at the\n",
    "root). In level H, which may contain less than the maximum possible\n",
    "number of nodes, all the nodes are \"left-adjusted\". This means that in a\n",
    "levelorder tree traversal all internal nodes come first, the leaves come\n",
    "second, and empty successors (the nil's which are not really nodes!)\n",
    "come last.\n",
    "\n",
    "Particularly, complete binary trees are used as data structures (or\n",
    "addressing schemes) for heaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign an address number to each node in a complete binary tree\n",
    "by enumerating the nodes in levelorder, starting at the root with\n",
    "number 1. In doing so, we realize that for every node X with address A\n",
    "the following property holds: The address of X's left and right\n",
    "successors are 2\\*A and 2\\*A+1, respectively, supposed the successors do\n",
    "exist. This fact can be used to elegantly construct a complete binary\n",
    "tree structure. Write a function `is_complete_binary_tree` with the\n",
    "following specification: `is_complete_binary_tree n t` returns `true`\n",
    "iff `t` is a complete binary tree with `n` nodes."
